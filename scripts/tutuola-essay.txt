ON THE QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONER: நான் யாரு?
A Telling in the Style of the Palm-Wine Drinkard's Cousin

You are not one self and this is not a tragedy it is more like the weather which comes and goes.

I will now tell you about a Man I knew who answered the Proust Questionnaire and this Man he answered it many times in his life and each time he was a Different Man entirely though he had the same body and the same name which his mother gave him when he was born.

In the year 1987 when I first met this Man he was answering the questions and when they asked him "What is your idea of perfect happiness?" he said immediately without thinking "A cabin in Montana with good light for reading" and he believed this answer was The Truth About Himself.

But after ten years had passed and it was now 1997 and the Questionnaire came to him again by Accident when it fell from a box that was stained with his seed which had dried there, he answered the same question but this time he said "For my daughter to stop crying at night" and this was also The Truth but it was a Different Truth from the first one though it came from the same mouth.

Then in 2007 he said "To finish the book I am writing" and in 2017 he came back around like a Snake eating its own tail and said again "A cabin in Montana with good light for reading" which was the First Answer returning to him like a Ghost of his younger self.

And this Man thought that the returning of his First Answer meant Something Very Important about Who He Really Was. But I tell you this: it meant something the way weather means something which is to say it meant Everything and Nothing at the same time.

Now I must tell you about a Great Philosopher who lived one thousand years ago in the place called Kashmir where the mountains touch the sky and this Philosopher his name was Abhinavagupta which in English means "the secret of being continuously new" and this name was True because he was always New even when he was the Same.

This Abhinavagupta he watched people in the Theatre watching the Plays and he saw a Strange Thing happening there. When the Actor who was playing Rāma began to Grieve on the left side of the stage, all the people in the audience they began to Grieve also but their Grief was not their own Grief and it was not Rāma's Grief either because everyone knew it was only a Play.

So then Abhinavagupta asked himself Whose Grief Is This Grief? and after thinking about it for many years in the mountains he said: This Grief belongs to Consciousness Recognizing Itself.

And when this Recognition happens it creates what he called camatkāra which means The Shiver of Wonder that runs through your body when you suddenly Understand something that you always knew but had Forgotten.

This Shiver it does not need anything outside itself to exist. It is Complete like a Cat sitting in a Sunbeam not waiting for anything just Being.

Now I must tell you about another Man who lived in France and his name was Lacan and he smoked too many cigarettes until his fingers were Yellow and he said things that made people's heads spin around like Tops. This Lacan he said that the Self which we call I is basically a Grammatical Error that we all keep making over and over again.

Because you see we all call ourselves by the same name I and when you say I you think you are talking about Yourself but actually you are just putting a Word in the place where You ought to be. The Word stands there like a Substitute Teacher when the Real Teacher has disappeared.

And two thousand years before Lacan was even born there was a Man in ancient India called Pāṇini who was a Grammarian and this Pāṇini he wrote down all the Rules of Language so precisely that if Computers had existed in 400 BCE his Grammar could have run them like Programs.

What Pāṇini discovered was this: The Nominative Case which is the case of I only appears when Nothing Else has claimed the noun first. You don't get to be I because you are the Doer or the Thinker. You get to be I because you are What Remains after every other relationship has been counted and there is still This Left Over like the water at the bottom of the pot after everyone has drunk their fill.

So the Subject is not a Thing at all. It is an Absence that appears when all the Relationships have been mapped and named and there is still Something There which cannot be named because it is Doing the Naming.

This is why when you try to talk about Yourself it is like trying to catch a Trout with your bare hands in the river. Every time you think you have grasped it the Trout slips away because your hands are covered with that slippery substance you used earlier when you were Pleasuring Yourself alone in your room.

The Questionnaire it has thirty-five questions and these questions they are not Polite Questions like "How are you today?" No these are Questions that go straight down into the Ice and when you answer them Honestly something Cold touches your feet and you realize you are standing in Deep Water.

Now there is a Woman philosopher at Harvard her name is Christine Korsgaard and she says that the Self is not something we Find lying around like a Stone. It is something we Make like a Quilt and from the day we are born until the day we die we are Sewing this Quilt with pieces of fabric we take from other people: our mother's phrases, our teacher's posture, songs we heard when we were young and Angry, a stranger's coat we saw once and never forgot because it was Beautiful.

We are a Quilt made entirely of other people's Fabrics and in these Modern Times we try to sell this Quilt like a Brand like we are a Product in the Market but this is a Foolish thing to do because Quilts are meant to keep people Warm not to be sold for Money.

The instruction is this: Answer the Questions once and then do your best to Forget them completely. Don't think about your Answers too much or they will become like a Mask you wear and you will start to believe the Mask is your Face but it is not your Face it is only a Mask.

Then after ten years have passed when you have Forgotten everything answer the Questions again and when you see how Different your Answers are you will experience camatkāra the Shiver of Recognition.

The Questions they don't change but I change. I change the way a River changes and the Bridge thinks it is seeing the Same River every day but the River knows Better.

Lacan he had another idea called objet petit a which means the Little Object and this is the Thing we are always Looking For but can never Find like when you open the Refrigerator at Night when you are not even Hungry but you are Searching for Something though you don't know What.

It is the Hole in your Understanding that makes you want to answer a Questionnaire in the First Place. You are Seeking Something and you don't know What It Is and even if you Found It you wouldn't Recognize It but the Looking itself that is The Important Thing the Looking is Everything.

In ancient India they had a word for this Recognition and the word was pratyabhijñā which means not Seeking something New but Remembering something you always Knew but Forgot like when Buddha sat under the Tree and Became Enlightened which just means he Remembered what he always Knew but had Forgotten because of all the Noise in his Head.

The Questionnaire it is a Machine for producing this Shiver this camatkāra. Not the Answers themselves but the Moment Between reading the Question and beginning to Answer when you are Nobody In Particular just an Absence waiting to be Filled with Words.

In that Pause which lasts only a Second or Two you experience what the ancient Kashmiris called svātantrya which means Complete Freedom the Freedom of not Needing Anything Outside Yourself to Be What You Are.

Like a Cat in a Sunbeam. The Cat it is not Waiting for anything. The Cat is Complete.

And you also you are Complete but you keep Forgetting this because we are Cruel to one another in these Times of Late Capitalism where everything Must Be Sold including our own Selves.

The world it moves Faster now than it did in 1890 when Proust first answered these Questions. In those days a Person might be One Thing for their whole life: a Baker or a Countess or a Disappointment to their Father.

But now we can be Twelve Different Things before Lunch and then vomit in the Bathroom and be Seven or Nine More Things before we go to Sleep at Night.

This is Confusing yes but it is also an Opportunity because if you are Not One Self then you don't have to Defend any Particular Self against the Others. You can just Watch as the Different Selves come and go like Clouds and Clouds are Beautiful and Nobody argues with Clouds.

What is your idea of Perfect Happiness?

The Question it is a Door and behind that Door is Another Door and behind that Door is a Room with No Floor only a Sky full of Clouds and you have been Falling through that Sky your whole Life not knowing where you are Going.

But the Falling itself that is the Happiness. Whatever Nature you have exists in the Fall.

Answer the Questions. Wait Ten Years. Answer them Again.

Notice what is Different. Notice what is the Same. Notice that Different and Same are only Words and you are Not a Word you are the One Using the Words with other people to either Lift Them Up or Put Them Down and we all do Both but we must Practice doing more of the Lifting Up.

The freedom of the uninterrupted Delight of I-consciousness is completely Independent of any reference to Anything Else. This is what Abhinavagupta said in Sanskrit one thousand years ago and it is still True today.

The Cat in the Sunbeam knows this.
The River knows this.
Now you know it too.
Or you always Knew it.
That is the Whole Point.

END OF STORY

P.S. This story was told to me by my Uncle who heard it from a Talking Tree he met on the Road to Self-Knowledge and the Tree said it learned these things from the Wind which learned them from the Silence between Words which is where all Truth Lives when it is not being Disturbed by people like us who cannot stop Talking even when we have Nothing to Say.
