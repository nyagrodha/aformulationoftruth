The Self
That in which all these worlds seem to exist steadily,
that of which all these worlds are a possession,
that from which all these worlds rise,
that for which all these exist, 
that for which all these worlds come into existencce and that whcih is indeed all these--
     that alone is teh existing philoaophy.

Let us cherish that self, whicis the reality in the heart.
