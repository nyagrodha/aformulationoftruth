        <h2>ROOM ATTENDANT</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            I am motivated to transition into hospitality because the guest-centered values closely align with the patient-centered care I have practiced over the past two years in healthcare settings. In caring for patients, I developed a strong respect for privacy and discretion, providing calm, assured support without prying or unnecessary questions. I take pride in accommodating needs thoughtfully and helping people feel comfortable, respected, and at ease.
