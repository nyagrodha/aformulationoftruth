            <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                We believe in radical privacy. This is not merely a policy—it is a foundational principle.
                In a world increasingly hostile to individual privacy, this space is designed to be different.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Your data belongs to you. Not to us. Not to advertisers. Not to algorithms designed to manipulate your attention.
            </div>

            <h2>Billionaire playbook 101: always remember to spay and neuter political subjects</h2>

            <p>
                So-called "social" media hollow out political life by severing it from bodies in shared space. Political agency has always depended on physical co-presence—people gathered together, visible to one another, capable of collective risk and collective refusal. Platforms replace this with connection without assembly: expression without consequence, participation without leverage. The crowd dissolves into isolated users, each alone with a screen, mistaking synchronized solitude for a public.
            </p>

            <p>
                This disembodiment is not incidental. Power has always feared bodies together more than opinions expressed apart. A hashtag does not block a road; a feed does not organize a strike. Social media captures anger and routes it into safe, legible, monetizable gestures—likes, shares, posts—while rewarding performance over solidarity. Politics becomes personal branding, moral display, and algorithmic visibility, fracturing collective energy into individualized narratives that never quite cohere into force.
            </p>

            <p>
                The smartphone is the 21st-century billionaire class's most elegant tool of social domination: a portable enclosure that keeps people separated while convincing them they are connected. It privatizes the public sphere, collapses shared time into an endless feed, and replaces mutual obligation with managed attention. People speak constantly but assemble rarely; they feel engaged yet remain politically inert. What presents itself as community functions, in practice, as pacification—neutralizing political subjects by isolating their bodies while harvesting their voices.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>

            <h3>Server Logs</h3>
            <p>
                Like all web servers, our server maintains basic access logs for operational purposes (debugging,
                preventing abuse). These logs contain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>IP addresses (automatically rotated and deleted after 7 days)</li>
                <li>Request timestamps</li>
                <li>Requested URLs</li>
                <li>HTTP status codes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These logs are never used for tracking or profiling and are retained only for operational security.
            </p>

            <h3>Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                All data transmission occurs over HTTPS (TLS 1.3). Newsletter email addresses are encrypted at rest
                using AES-256-GCM with keys stored separately from the encrypted data.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Request a copy of any data we store about you</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> Request deletion of your email address from our newsletter database</li>
                <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Receive your data in a portable format</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the link in any email</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>

            <p>
                This privacy policy reflects a philosophical commitment, not just a legal obligation.
                The self-inquiry encouraged by the questionnaire requires a safe, private space.
                Without privacy, honest self-reflection becomes performative—shaped by the imagined gaze of others.
            </p>
