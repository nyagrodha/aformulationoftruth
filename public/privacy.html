            <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                A free society demands that we enjoy robust legal protection of citizen's privacy. What follows is not a policy—it is a practice. We practice privacy here knowing full well we are bound to faceplant in some unforeseen way. Kindly alert me via <a href="#" onclick="this.href='mailto:'+atob('Zm9ybWl0c2VsZmlzZW1wdGluZXNzQGFmb3JtdWxhdGlvbm9mdHJ1dGguY29t')" style="font-size: 0.85em;">email</a> if you notice an opportunity to better protect users' autonomy.
                In a world increasingly hostile to individual privacy, this space is designed to be different.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Your data belongs to you. Not to us. Not to advertisers. Not to algorithms designed to manipulate your attention.
            </div>

            <h2>Billionaire playbook 101: always remember to spay and neuter political subjects</h2>

            <p>
                So-called "social" media hollow out political life by severing it from bodies in shared space. Political agency has always depended on physical co-presence—people gathered together, visible to one another, capable of collective risk and collective refusal. Platforms replace this with connection without assembly: expression without consequence, participation without leverage. The crowd dissolves into isolated users, each alone with a screen, mistaking synchronized solitude for a public.
            </p>

            <p>
                This disembodiment is not incidental. Power fears bodies together more than opinions expressed apart. A hashtag does not block a road; a feed does not organize a strike. Social media captures anger and routes it into safe, legible, monetizable gestures—likes, shares, posts—while rewarding performance over solidarity. Politics becomes personal branding, moral display, and algorithmic visibility. The ruling class deploys technology to fracture collective consciousness into discrete narratives that never quite cohere into force.
            </p>

            <p>
                The smartphone is the 21st-century billionaire class's most ubiquitous tool of social domination: a portable enclosure that separates us while convincing us we are connected. It privatizes the public sphere, collapses shared time into an endless feed, and replaces mutual obligation with managed attention. People speak constantly but assemble rarely; they feel engaged yet remain politically disenfranchised, willingly. What presents itself as community functions, in practice, as pacification—neutralizing the actual political force of subjects by isolatng our bodies. This while harvesting our voices as data points to be sold at market value. And we earn not a penny from their hundreds of millions.

                <li><strong>No tracking cookies:</strong> We do not use tracking cookies or similar technologies</li>
                <li><strong>No analytics:</strong> No Google Analytics, no Facebook Pixel, no third-party analytics services</li>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>

            <h3>Server Logs</h3>
            <p>
                Like all web servers, our server maintains basic access logs for operational purposes (debugging,
                preventing abuse). These logs contain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>IP addresses (automatically rotated. Most logs are deleted within minutes some after 7 days)</li>
                <li>Request timestamps</li>
                <li>Requested URLs</li>
                <li>HTTP status codes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not use these data for tracking or profiling. Data is retained only insofar as it concerns operational security in the contexts of the shitty world described above that we've all played a part in. Here we reist.
            </p>

            <h3>Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                All data transmission occurs over HTTPS (TLS 1.3). Newsletter email addresses are encrypted at rest
                using AES-256-GCM with keys stored separately from the encrypted data.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Request a copy of any data we store about you</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> Request deletion of your email address from our newsletter database</li>
                <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Receive your data in a portable format</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the link in any email</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>

            <p>
                This privacy policy reflects a philosophical commitment, not just a legal obligation.
                The self-inquiry encouraged by the questionnaire requires a safe, private space.
                Without privacy, self reflection becomes performative—shaped by the imagined gaze of others.
            </p>
