### You are not one self.

**This is not a tRaGedY. It is more like the weather.**

## You are not one self.

This is not a tragedy. It is more like weather.

I knew a man once who answered the Proust Questionnaire. It was 1987. His idea of perfect happiness? "A cabin in Montana with good light for reading."

In 1997 happenstantially coming upon the questionnaire that had shifted from within a box and now stained with his soon-to-be crusty sfacim, again he answered. His idea of perfect happiness? Well that had become "for my daughter to stop crying at night."

In 2007 it was "to finish the book I'm writing."

In 2017 it was, like clockwork, "a cabin in Montana with good light for reading."

He thought this meant something. Therein lies the ego's rub not upon the phallusper se. And it did. It meant something the way weather means something.

A thousand or so years ago in what was then as now Kashmir a philosopher named Abhinavagupta lived. Doing what polymaths of brahmanical intellectual tradition do, he likely grew a long beard. Abhinava's name against an ornament of 'skrit that causes mis ojos to glitter translates to English as "the secret of being continuously new." fwiw his idears kinda rock one's headspace; unlikely he posed for a picture. But I am aware of one portrait some devotee drew up of the man, the polymath, the legend. Reportedly his eyes shine red—inebriated as we may be by the rasa—surrounded by yoginīs on a raised platform chalice in hand he sips. Though I've yet to see it, the portrait has appeared in a dream. Or so I think I recall.

In any case, Abhinava watched people watch plays, nāṭakam in the 'skrit sans devanagari

And he noticed that when Rāma (whose creator coined the character, nee god's name as upon māra, or murder, he meditated so long around this common thug a valmīk, or termite mound, enveloped him to become known as Valmīkī in the records of how it's been/was) grieved stage left, the audience felt grief. But this grief was not theirs. The audience hadn't lost anyone; neither was it Rāma's grief either—everyone knew it was a nāṭakam, a play.

So whose grief was it?

Abhinavagupta said: it belongs to consciousness recognizing itself.[^1]

Doing so it creates this effect that metaphor can't quite capture. Likely with a head full of LSD some folks remark it's like looking in a mirror and seeing that you are also the mirror; I'd paint a different picture with words employing '2-CB'. Recognise within you, the I, as an absence. Words alone engender and inaugurate its possibility just as around the inside clay the emptiness of a pot.

He called this *camatkāra*, which means something like "wonder" or "the shiver."

The shiver doesn't need an object. It just needs you to stop for a second.

Lacan was a French psychoanalyst who smoked too many cigarettes and said things like "the unconscious is structured like a language."

He also said the self is basically a grammatical error.

When you say "I," you are not referring to yourself. You are referring to a word that stands where you should be. The real you—if there is one—is somewhere else, hiding behind the sentence.

This is why talking about yourself feels like trying to catch a fish with your hands.

Every time you grab, it slips.

---

The questionnaire has thirty-five questions.

> "What is your greatest fear?"

> "What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?"

> "How would you like to die?"

These are not polite questions. They are holes in the ice.

If you answer them honestly, something cold touches your feet.

Christine Korsgaard is a philosopher at Harvard. She says the self is not something you find. It is something you make.

Every choice is a kind of sewing.

You stitch yourself together out of what's available: your mother's phrases, your teacher's posture, songs you heard when you were seventeen, a stranger's coat you saw once and never forgot.

You are a quilt made of other people's fabric.

This is not sad. Quilts are warm.

---

The instruction is: answer once. Then forget the questions for ten years.

This is important.

If you think about the questions too often, you will start to believe your answers are who you are. They are not who you are. They are who you were on a Tuesday in November when you were tired and the light was gray.

Ten years later you will be someone else answering the same questions.

The questions don't change. You do.

This is like a river passing the same bridge twice. The bridge thinks it's seeing the same river. The river knows better.

Lacan had a concept called *objet petit a*. The little object. The thing you're always looking for but can never find.

It's the reason you open the refrigerator when you're not hungry.

It's the reason you answer questionnaires about yourself.

You're looking for something. You don't know what it is. If you found it, you wouldn't recognize it. But looking feels important.

The looking is the thing.

In India they have a word: *pratyabhijñā*. It means recognition.

Not learning something new. Remembering something you always knew but forgot.

Like when you walk into a room and suddenly remember you've been there before, in a dream or another life or last Thursday.

That shiver.

The questionnaire is a machine for producing that shiver.

Not the answers. The moment between the question and the answer. The pause where you are nobody in particular, just consciousness wondering what it will say.

That pause is freedom.

The eleventh-century Kashmiris had a word for that too: *svātantrya*. It means "not needing anything outside yourself to be what you are."

Like a cat in a sunbeam. The cat isn't waiting for anything. The cat is complete.

You are also complete. You just keep forgetting.

The world moves faster now.

In 1890, when Proust answered these questions in a parlor in Paris, a person might be one thing for their whole life. A baker. A countess. A disappointment to their father.

Now you can be twelve things before lunch.

This is confusing but it is also an opportunity.

If you are not one self, you don't have to defend any particular self. You can watch them come and go like clouds.

Clouds are beautiful. Nobody argues with clouds.

---

## What is your idea of perfect happiness?

The question is a door.

Behind the door is another door.

Behind that door is a room with no floor, only sky.

You've been falling through that sky your whole life.

The fall is the happiness.

---

Answer. Wait ten years. Answer again.

Notice that you are different.

Notice that you are the same.

Notice that "different" and "same" are just words, and you are not a word.

You are the one using the words.

You are the one who can put them down.

## सर्वथा पुनर् अविच्छिन्नचमत्कारनिरपेक्षस्वातन्त्र्याहंविमर्शे

*The freedom of the uninterrupted delight of I-consciousness is completely independent of any reference to anything else.*

**—Abhinavagupta**

---

The cat in the sunbeam knows this.

The river knows this.

Now you know it too.

Or you always did.

That's the whole point.

## Notes

[^1]: See *Abhinavabhāratī*, Abhinavagupta's commentary on Bharata's *Nāṭyaśāstra*, particularly his gloss on the *rasasūtra* (NS 6.31). The Kashmiris called the broader philosophical framework *pratyabhijñā*—recognition. You don't acquire your nature; you remember it. The aesthetic shiver and the liberating insight share the same structure: *saṃvid* glimpsing *saṃvid*. Rasa opens a crack; through it, consciousness catches sight of itself. Cf. the famous compound: *sarvathā punar avicchinnacamatkāranirapekṣasvātantryāhaṃvimarśe*—the freedom of the uninterrupted delight [in] I-consciousness (*ahamvimarśe*), is completely independent of any reference to anything else.
