PROUST QUOTES
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast, but when we
say this we imagine that hour as
placed in an obscure and distant
future. It never occurs to us that it
has any connection with the day
already begun or that death could
arrive this same afternoon, this
afternoon which is so certain and
which has every hour filled in
advance.
