said things, or lived in a way the
consciousness of which is so
unpleasant to him in later life that he
would gladly, if he could, expunge it
from his memory.

The bonds that unite another person
to ourselves exist only in our mind.
Memory as it grows fainter relaxes

them, and notwithstanding the
illusion by which we would fain be
cheated and with which, out of love,
friendship, politeness, deference,
duty, we cheat other people, we
exist alone. Man is the creature that
cannot emerge from himself, that
knows his fellows only in himself;
when he asserts the contrary, he is
lying

We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast, but when we
say this we imagine that hour as
placed in an obscure and distant
future. It never occurs to us that it
has any connection with the day

afternoon which is so certain and
which has every hour filled in
advance.

artist recreates those aspects of
reality which represent his
fundamental view of man's nature.
