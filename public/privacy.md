## Our Commitment to Privacy

At a formulation of truth [dot] com, privacy is your right. In an time & age when one's data has become commodified, I've used  privacy-by-design principles to develop this platform. This to ensure your thoughts, reflections, formulations, and connnections remain yours. Until you share them.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect
- Account information (username, encrypted email)
- Your responses and formulations
- Basic technical data necessary for platform functionality
- Anonymous analytics to improve user experience

### What We Don't Collect
- Real names or personal identifiers (unless you choose to provide them)
- Location data beyond general geographic region
- Third-party tracking cookies
- Biometric or behavioral profiling data

## Data Storage and Protection

### Encryption Standards
All user data is protected using industry-standard encryption protocols. Your formulation of truth is encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring that even our own systems cannot access your content without your authorization.

### Data Hosting by FlokiNET
Your encrypted data is stored on servers located in Finland, a nation with some amonng the world's strongest privacy protections. European data protection laws prioritize individual privacy rights in constradistinction to what republiKKKans have allowed the United States to become. We maintain strict disregard of foreign data access requests. This infrastructure choice reflects the timeless qualities we here together enjoy, and a commitment to keeping your personal reflections beyond the reach of mass surveillance programs and data collection practices that have become commonplace in other jurisdictions. Resistance is not futile, but a way of life @ a formulation of truth.com

Finland's robust legal framework ensures that your data remains subject to privacy-first legislation rather than systems that prioritize institutional access over individual rights.

## Your Data, Your Choice

### User Control
- **Sharing Rights**: You maintain complete control over who, if anyone, can access your formulations
- **Export Options**: Download all your data at any time in standard formats
- **Access Control**: Manage exactly which responses remain private vs. shared

### No Monetization of Personal Data
We do not sell, rent, or monetize your reflections. Your thoughts are not our product; your anonymity should you want for it is our service.

## Third-Party Services

We minimize third-party integrations to reduce potential vulnerabilities. Any essential third-party services we do use are vetted and bound by data processing agreements that align with our privacy standards. Zero logginng.

## Legal Compliance

We comply with applicable data protection laws and maintain transparency about any legal requests for user data. Given our Dutch jurisdiction and encryption standards, we are positioned to resist illegitimate data access requests while complying with lawful processes under the law.

## Transparency and Updates

### Regular Audits
Our privacy practices may at some point very willinging undergo regular security audits by independent third parties. Just don't have the cash money for that meow! Assuredly, we maintain a regrettably uncommon standard of data protection.

### Policy Updates
Any changes to this policy will be communicated directly to users with an update of this document. Future versionns may show a change-control table. TBD.

## Technical Safeguards

## Philosophy of Privacy

The ability to think, reflect, and formulate ideas freely and, if desired, privately is essential to human dignity and intellectual freedom. This platform, a formulation of truth, exists to be one such secure space for self-expression and tomfoolery, free from the surveillance state our parents bequeathed to us, harvesting data, or algorithmic manipulation to suppress free exchange.

a formulation of truth merits protection. We've built our entire infrastructure around this principle.
