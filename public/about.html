            <h2>On Self-Inquiry</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Ramana Maharshi</strong> taught that the path to truth begins with the simple question: <em>"Who am I?"</em>
                This practice of <strong>self-inquiry</strong> (ātma-vicāra) strips away the layers of identification with thoughts,
                emotions, and experiences, revealing the unchanging witness beneath.
            </p>
            <div class="quote">
                "The question 'Who am I?' is not really meant to get an answer, the question 'Who am I?'
                is meant to dissolve the questioner."
            </div>
            <p>
                The questionnaire you encounter here is not a psychological survey, but an invitation to this same inquiry—
                an archaeology of the self, excavating the assumptions and identifications that construct the "I."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recollection as Translation</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Marcel Proust</strong>, in <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, demonstrated that memory is not mere retrieval
                but re-creation. The past exists not as fixed fact but as a living reconstruction, forever colored by the present
                consciousness that recalls it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recollection is translation.</strong> What is a subject doing when it remembers, when it reflects, when it
                articulates inner experience? It is rendering shareable something that is inherently <em>first-personal</em>—
                translating the untranslatable, making public the private, transforming the ineffable into language.
            </p>
            <div class="quote">
                "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."
                <br>— Marcel Proust
            </div>
            <p>
                Every response to a question about yourself is an act of translation. The prereflective experience becomes
                reflective awareness becomes linguistic expression. In this process, truth is not discovered but <em>formulated</em>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Paradox of Sharing the Unshared</h2>
            <p>
                There is a profound paradox at the heart of self-knowledge: the self that knows is attempting to know itself.
                The subject becomes its own object. The <em>first-personal</em> perspective—that irreducible "what it is like"
                to be you—must be translated into <em>third-personal</em> language to be communicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                This questionnaire asks you to perform this impossible task: to make shareable what is fundamentally private,
                to externalize what is internal, to objectify what is subjective. In doing so, you may discover that the self
                you are trying to describe is transformed by the very act of description.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Truth</strong>, then, is not found but <strong>formulated</strong>. It emerges in the gap between
                experience and expression, between being and articulation, between the questioner and the question itself.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>This Practice</h2>
            <p>
                Like Ramana's inquiry, this is a practice of dissolution. Like Proust's recollection, this is an act of
                translation. The questions are mirrors, the answers are translations, and the truth—if there is such a
                thing—lives in the space between.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no god to judge your answers. There is only you, attempting to render yourself legible to yourself,
                discovering that the self is both the translator and the text, both the question and the answer, both the
                formulation and the truth.
