104                 It may indicate as bellwether  the declining currency of honesty that aformulationoftruth.com still existed to register as a domain. And there is a lot in the name of truth.

105      The phrase 'a formulation of truth' was ascertained from a seminar I attended as a graduate student of Sanskrit literature with below-average intelligence relative to the peers within the group. The professor, JB, and the class translated brahmā, the nominative singular form of brahman, a neuter noun -an ending n 
    oun in Sanskrit, as 'a formulation of truth'. </p>

So this idea to serve the Proust questionnaire arose in the awareness the 'I-I' know some eight or so years ago. This I-I know  as the subject of the actions their body daily makes; it is  
    who to me I know more intimately familiar than any other subject. And yet this I remains greater a mystery possessed of curiosity than a knower or possessor of truth.  The creator's creation may be as much for the need of the creator to express their formulation of truth, thereby translating from concept into reality
